# Prisma Client Explorer

Welcome to the Prisma client explorer in CodeSandbox! 👋

## How to use

Run the following command to explore the Prisma client API:

```
yarn start
```

## Features

There are three folders with scripts that you can use to play around with the Prisma client API:

- 📖 src/reading-data
- ✏️ src/writing-data
- ⭐️ src/more-data-access

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Database writes are disabled by default! Please fork this CodeSandbox and use your own Prisma Demo server to perform database writes. Visit [the docs](www.prisma.io/docs/get-started) to learn how to setup a Prisma Demo server.
