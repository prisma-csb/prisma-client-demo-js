# Prisma Client Explorer

Welcome to the Prisma client explorer in CodeSandbox! 👋

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This CodeSandbox is connected to a database that has writes disabled. Follow the [setup instructions](./SETUP.md) to try out the Prisma client API with your own demo database.

## Features

There are three folders with scripts that you can use to play around with the Prisma client API:

- 📖 src/reading-data
- ✏️ src/writing-data
- ⭐️ src/more-data-access

## How to use

Once you have forked your own version of this CodeSandbox (see instructions [here](./SETUP.md)), you can start exploring the Prisma client API:

```
yarn start
```

You can also directly run the scripts defined in [`package.json`](./package.json#L17), e.g.:

```
yarn filtering-and-sorting # executes `src/reading-data/filterting-and-sorting.ts`
```
